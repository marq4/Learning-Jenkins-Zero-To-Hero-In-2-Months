* Tasks: 
	+ Create 2 Jenkins pipelines: 
		- Code Quality: on PR to main or push to any other branch. 
		- Release: deploys Git Release to PROD on merge to main: 
			~ Bump SemVer. 
			~ Tag the commit & Git release. 
			~ Dockerize. 
			~ Deploy to PROD (K8). 				// Or simply echo out kubectl commands. 

* Notes:
	+ Use Poetry. 
	+ Do not even attempt to work with K8. Simply echo out the kubectl commands. 
	+ Make sure these Jenkins pipelines run at top speed.
