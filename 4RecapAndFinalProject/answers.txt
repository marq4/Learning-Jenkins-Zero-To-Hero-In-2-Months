A1: 
	+ It will fail with: 
		groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: DB_HOST. 
	+ Because 'Test' stage does not have access to that env var (only 'Init' stage does). 

A2: 
	+ Single server is acceptable for: 
		- Dev/test environments. 
		- POC demos. 
		- Very low-traffic apps where cost optimization is critical & some downtime is acceptable. 
	+ Single server is unsuitable for production because: 
		- We must avoid single point of failure: IF the EC2 instance fails, the entire app becomes unavailable. 
		- Doesn't scale: doesn't handle traffic spikes. 
	+ Instead we do:
		- For a small/simple app: serverless: no server management, auto-scales, pay-per-use. 
		- Otherwise: multi-server architecture with: 
			; Load Balancer: distributes traffic. 
			; Auto Scaling Group: auto adjust capacity based on demand. 
			; Multi-AZ deployment: spread instances across Availability Zones for fault tolerance. 
			; Health checks: auto replace unhealthy instances.
