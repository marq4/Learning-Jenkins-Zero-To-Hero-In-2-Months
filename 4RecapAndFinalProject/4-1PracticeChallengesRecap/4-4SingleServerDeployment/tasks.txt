* Tasks: 
	+ Manually copy the app code over to a single AWS EC2 instance. 
	+ Manually configure the app to run as a service (starts on boot, always running). 
	+ Update pipeline from previous practice challenge to copy code over to the single EC2 server, 
		and make sure our app is running the latest code that we pushed to Git. 

* Notes: 
	+ The proposed solution uses Amazon Linux.
