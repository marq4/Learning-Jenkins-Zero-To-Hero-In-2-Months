* Solution: 
	1.- AWS Console > EC2 > Launch instance. 
	2.- Ubuntu, t3.micro, SSH key, default VPC, Allow HTTP(S). 
	3.- Copy "Public DNS" address. 
	4.- $ ssh -i SSHAccess.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-188-47-153.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com 
	5.- Yes. 
	6.- $ hostname 
	7.- $ java -version 
	8.- Go to Jenkins docs > Linux > Debian > Installation of Java.  
	9.- $ sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-21-jre 
	10.- Install latest LTS of Jenkins by following documentation. 
	11.- $ sudo systemctl status jenkins				# Should be enabled, active (running). 
	12.- Go to the instance's Security Group > Edit inbound rules > Add rule > 8080, TCP, anywhere IPv4. 
	13.- Open up http://<DNS_NAME>:8080 on web browser. 
	14.- Unlock Jenkins: $ sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword 
	15.- Install suggested plugins. 
	16.- Create First Admin User. 
	17.- Create a Freestyle Job > Build Steps: Execute shell > echo "Hello Jenkins!" > Save > Build Now > Console Output. 
	18.- Terminate EC2 instance. 

* Notes: 
	+ We can't simply "apt install jenkins" on Ubuntu because the repo isn't enabled by default. 
		- Because even if it were, it would usually be outdated, 
			as Ubuntu freezes versions at release time (only applies security patches). 
	+ It is recommended to install "fontconfig" along with Java to prevent issues with plugins. 
		- Because Jenkins (through Java) may need to render or measure text.
