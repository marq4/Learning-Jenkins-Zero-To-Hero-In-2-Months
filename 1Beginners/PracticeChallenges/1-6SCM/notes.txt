* Notes: 
	+ This challenge is CONSIDERABLY more laborious than the previous ones. 
	+ May take you multiple hours, days even. 

* What we'll learn/practice: 
	+ Basic Docker commands: 
		- Creating a new container, specifying port mappings. 
		- Stopping / starting an existing container. 
		- Connecting to a running container as root user. 
	+ SSH: 
		- GitHub Deploy Key. 
		- ssh-keygen. 
		- ssh-keyscan. 
	+ Fundamental Git workflow: 
		- Create a new repo. 
		- Cloning an empty repo. 
		- Adding and uploading code to the repo. 
		- Making changes to code. 
		- Working on a new branch. 
	+ Jenkins / Groovy: 
		- Difference between implict and explicit code checkout. 
		- Intermediate declarative pipeline directives: 
			' Parameters. 
			' Environment variables. 
			' Code check-out. 
		- Defining a Groovy variable. 
		- Groovy conditionals. 
	+ Python: 
		- Installing it. 
		- Working with virtual environments. 
		- Installing project dependencies (requirements file). 
		- Pytest module & JUnit plugin.
