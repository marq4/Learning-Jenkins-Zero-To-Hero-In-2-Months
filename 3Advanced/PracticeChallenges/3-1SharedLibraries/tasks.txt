* Exercise description: 
	+  Suppose we expect the number of Jenkins Pipelines to grow like crazy soon. 
	+ We need a way to place all common code in a central location and avoid code duplication. 

* Tasks: 
	+ Create Shared Libraries that contain the following functionality: 
		- A function that displays a welcome message. 
		- A custom step that sends a Slack notification when a build completes: build status, job name, build #, and URL. 
		- The entire Trivy functionality, allowing user to specify severity, exit code, and format. 

* Specifications: 
	+ Default branch should only contain welcome and Slack stuff. 
	+ Feature branch should also contain Trivy stuff. 
	+ The Trivy command should actually be called by a shell script. 

* Notes: 
	+ Do not worry about setting up Slack if you don't already have it. 
	+ Remove all unnecessary stages from the Jenkinsfile we've been building in the previous courses.
