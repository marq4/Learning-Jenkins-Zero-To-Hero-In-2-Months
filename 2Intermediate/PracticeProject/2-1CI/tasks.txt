* Exercise description: 
	+ Suppose we are starting a new company (Learning Jenkins Inc). 
	+ We will adopt a microserice architecture for our system(s) / product(s). 
	+ We may fork / import some repos. 

* Requirements: 
	+ DO NOT manually create Jenkins project for each repo / branch. 
	+ When a repo / branch contains a Jenkinsfile, build it automatically. 
		' You will need ngrok for GitHub to be able to reach your local Jenkins on Docker. 
	+ Build should fail if any critical vulnerabilities are found in the project's dependencies. 
	+ Only fix critical dependecy vulnerabilities (that aren't breaking-changes), and do it manually. 
	+ Enable timestamps only for "Install dependencies" CI stage. 
	+ Scan Docker image for vulneabilities using Trivy. 

* Tasks: 
	+ Create a new Organization in GitHub. 
	+ Get this repo into your new org: https://github.com/sidd-harth/solar-system-gitea 
	+ Manage all repos + branches for this new company from Jenkins. 
	+ CI Pipeline stages: 
		- Install dependencies. 
		- Dependency scanning: in parallel: NPM audit + OWASP dependency check. 
		- Unit testing. 
		- Code coverage (NYC): catch error. 
		- SAST (SonarQube). 
		- Dockerize. 

* Notes: 
	+ To avoid frustration when connecting the Jenkins Organization Folder to the GitHub Org: 
		- Jenkins has some of the most confusing, inconsistent UX out there. 
		- GitHub Server config wants "Secret text" credentials. 
		- GitHub Organization source wants "Username with password" credentials. 
		- Both use the same PAT. 
		- Fields randomly become read-only (e.g. API endpoint under Repository Sources). 
		- No clear error messages about what's wrong. 
	+ Recommendation: keep token values in notepad open until you've verified everything's working.
