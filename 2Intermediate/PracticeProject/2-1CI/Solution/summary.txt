* Security: 
	+ What measures were taken to ensure security in this Jenkins project? 
		Ans: 
		- Jenkins does not know my personal GitHub password. 
		- Did not hard-code any credentials into the Jenkinsfile. 
		- To allow Jenkins to access the GitHub repo, a GitHub Personal Access Token is used. 
		- The NVD API key is stored as a secret text credential in Jenkins. 
		- To avoid: Warning: A secret was passed to "dependencyCheck" using Groovy String interpolation, which is insecure: 
			; withEnv + ''': prevent Groovy interpolation, so the variable is passed to the tool directly rather than being interpolated by Jenkins first. 
		- Never use your real Docker Hub password directly in Jenkins, 
			instead use a Docker Hub Access Token. 

	+ Security risks ignored due to complexity: 
		- When we run the docker container manually to test the app we are passing the DB password as an envirionment variable. 
		- In production we would have to use Docker secrets + Docker Compose.
