* Tips: 
	+ Keep Blue Ocean open to monitor the execution of the new stage in the incremental Jenkinsfile. 
	+ To fulfill the requirement of triggering a new job after code changes are commited you'll need:
		- Ngrok. 
		- A GitHub webhook. 
		- Enable hook trigger on Jenkins. 
	+ If something goes wrong with the webhook: 
		- Open the ngrok web UI: http://localhost:4040. 
		- Inspect the Jenkins logs: 
			$ docker logs d4 
		- Keep the GitHub webhook web UI open and inspect the RESPONSEs. 
	+ Execute ngrok in a new Git Bash windows as it takes over and displays useful info (such as the URL). 
	+ Install dependencies: 
		$ npm install --no-audit 
	+ For dependency scanning we can declare a parent stage and 2 sub-stages. 
		- $ npm audit --audit-level=critical 
		- For OWASP dep check get the step syntax from: 
			' Jenkins > Learning Jenkins Inc Org Folder > solar-system repo > feature branch > Pipeline Syntax > Snippet Generator > Step: Dependency Check > Arguments: consult documentation (https://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-cli/arguments.html) > Generate Pipeline Script. 
			' Since we are using NPM, NOT YARN (another JS package manager), we can either ignore these errors: "Exception occurred initializing Yarn Audit Analyzer" / "Unable to read yarn audit output", or disable YARN. 
			' The build is stopped / failed in case of vulnerabilities via the publisher. 
	+ Code coverage command: 
		- $ npm run coverage 
	+ SonarQube: 
		- withSonarQubeEnv requires the name of the SonarQube server defined under System. 
		- We need to also wait for the quality gate. 
		- Wrap those 2 steps around a timeout of 10 minutes.
