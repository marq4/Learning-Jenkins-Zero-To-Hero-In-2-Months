* Organization Folders (best practice, recommended): 
	+ Provide a convenient way to automate creation/deletion of projects in Jenkins, as repos and branches 
		are added or removed. 
	+ Jenkins can auto detect new repos and generate a Multibranch Pipeline for: 
		- GitHub organizations. 
		- Bitbucket teams. 
		- GitLab groups. 
		- Gitea organizations. 

* SAST (Static App Security Testing) (static analysis): 
	+ Testing method that examines app source code to identify security vulnerabilities. 
	+ Code scanner that flags potential security issues. 
	+ SonarQube: OSS platform from SonarSource, helps continuously monitor code quality and perform automated code reviews. 
		- CLI: sonar-scanner. 
	+ Benefits: 
		- Early bug detection. 
		- Refactor & simplification. 
		- Automated code rule enforcement. 
	+ Enforcing quality standards with Quality Gates: 
		- Code smells. 
		- Security hot spots. 
		- Code coverage: % of code tested by automated tests. 

* Kubernetes (K8): 
	+ OSS container orchestration platform originally developed by Google and now maintained by CNCF. 
	+ Automate: deployment, scaling, management of containerized apps. 
	+ Nodes are the individual machines (physical or virtual) that make up the K8 cluster. 
	+ Nodes can be either Worker nodes, or Controller nodes. 
	+ Workers run the containers. 
	+ Controllers manage the cluster. Include: 
		- API server: entry point for managing the cluster, serves the K8 API. 
		- Controller Manager. 
		- Scheduler. 
		- etcd. 
	+ Pod: 
		- The smallest deployable unit. 
		- Represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster. 
		- Encapsulate 1 or more containers that share same network namespace, storage, and IP address. 
		- Often used to group containers that need to work together. 
	+ Deployments: 
		- High-level abstraction for managing Replica Sets and Pods. 
		- Provide declarative updates to apps, allowing us to describe the desired state. 
	+ Services: 
		- Access the Pods. 
		- Provide a stable & consistent network endpoint to access Pods. 
		- Can load balance traffic among multiple Pods. 
		- LB service Cloud: to expose my service to external world. Example: AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancer). Can cost. 
		- K8 Ingress: alternative to Cloud LB to manage and route HTTP(S) traffic into the cluster. 
			; Often configured with Service Type of: ClusterIP. 
			; ClusterIP services provide internal access to Pods within cluster, but are not directly exposed externally. 

* GitOps: 
	+ A framework where the entire code delivery process is controlled via Git. 
	+ Includes infra (IaC) & app definition as code and automation to deploy changes and rollback. 
	+ Can be considered an extension of IaC that uses Git as the VCS (Version Control System). 
	+ A GitOps Operator runs within one of the K8 clusters. It continuously monitors & pulls changes from the Git repo, 
		and applies them within the cluster it is running on, or another cluster. 
		- Makes sure the desired state always matches the actual state. 
	+ CICD: 
		- 2 Git repos: 
			; App code + app resources (config, certs). 
			; K8 Manifest (YAML specifications). 
		- GitOps Operator (ArgoCD Op), which is running on a K8 cluster, pulls the Manifest from the repo and will take necessary changes to match Taget State. 
		- Dev pushes code changes -> Jenkins CI -> update Manifest -> someone approves & merges PR feature branch to MAIN -> ArgoCD Op automatically applies changes to cluster. 

* ArgoCD: 
	+ Terminology: 
		- Application: group of K8 resources defined by a manifest. 
		- App source type: tool used to build the app. E.g.: Helm, Kustomize, Ksonnet. 
		- Project: logical grouping of apps, useful when ArgoCD is used by multiple teams. 
		- Target State: the desired state of an app, as represented by files in a Git repo. 
		- Live State: the current status of the app resources like: pods, configmap, secrets, created/deployed in the K8 cluster. 
		- Sync: when an ArgoCD App is created, it tries to synchronize the desired state in Git to the Live State in the cluster. 
			; The process of making an App move to its Target State, usually by applying changes to the K8 cluster. 
			; Reconciles the current cluster state with the Target State in Git. 
		- Sync Status: whether or not the Live State matches the Target State. 
		- Sync Operation Status: whether or not a Sync succeeded. 
		- Refresh (Option): compares the latest code in Git with the Live State, figures out what's different, and can initiate an automated Sync (or ask admin to do manually). 
		- Health (Assessments): for several standard K8 resources. 


* DAST: Dynamic App Security Testing. 
	+ Identify & address potential vulnerabilities before the app goes live. 
	+ DAST tools scan app's web UI and APIs to detect common vulnerabilities like: 
		- SQL injection. 
		- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). 
	+ Relies on the RUNNING app, instead of the source code. 
	+ One OSS tool is ZED Attack Proxy (ZAP). 				// zaproxy.org 
		- Provided by OWASP. 
	+ Commercial tools: Netsparker, Burp Suite.

* Global security settings: 
	+ Markup formatting: 
		- Default: plain text. 
		- Safe HTML: basic formatting. 
		- Custom formatters (plugins). 
	+ CSRF: 
		- Process: 
			; Hacker embeds request into hyperlink. 
			; Sends it to user that is logged into Jenkins. 
			; User clicks on link. 
			; Jenkins executes unauthorized build. 
		- Protection: 
			; Crumb Issuer: Jenkins checks for special token, the crumb. 

* Scaling: 
	- Horizontal: 
		; Easier to scale out quickly by simply adding more workers. 
		; Improves fault tolerance: if 1 machine fails, the other can handle the work load. 
	- Vertical: 
		; Scale up by upgrading our existing machines. 
		; More CPU + memory. 
	- Jenkins: 
		; Vertical scaling may not even fix the issues when the Controller node is overwhelmed: 
			` Garbage collection cycles may take even longer with more memory. 
			` It is still a single point of failure. 
		; At some point, we need to scale out (horizontally), by adding worker nodes.
